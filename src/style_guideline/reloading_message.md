# Reloading Message

You **must not** send an automatic message when the world is reloaded. It will clutter the chat unnecessarily and create a bad experience for the users.

Most of the time, the message will be an installation message, in which case you can use [Datapack Advancement](../conventions/datapack_advancement.md) instead.
