# Requirement

A datapack must satisfy these requirements to receive the Certified Datapack title

- Datapack must be portable, it must not be tied down to a specific save.
- Datapack must follow all of **Tier 3** Conventions.

## Note

1. We may rule a datapack out at our discretion, for reasons we would then specify.
2. This requirement is not final and can be changed in the future.

### Note from Convention Mod
- You can read the **Note from Convention Mod (Optional)** at the end of each page. It will help you understand it in more detail. It allows you to check your datapack more confidently before request review, and reduces the burden on the Datapack Reviewer even more.
- **Please note** that if your datapack uses `core`, `library`, `api`, `utils`, etc. from other datapakers. Those datapacks must also be certified. But don't worry, datapack reviewer will let you know. Your review status will be paused until those datapacks will be certified too. **It's not wrong to use it.**
- As for the review requests: If you publish your datapack on more than one website, adding it would be great. It doesn't have to be just `GitHub` or `Planetminecraft`. And if you're on the Minecraft Datapacks discord server, write your `Username#0000` too
- If you have additional questions or do not understand any part, you can ask on GitHub or mention @Convention Mod, @Datapack Reviewer on discord server.
