# Requirement

A datapack must satisfy these requirements to receive the Certified Datapack title

- Datapack must be portable, it must not be tied down to a specific save.
- Datapack must follow all of **Tier 3** Conventions.
- Use `core`, `library`, `API`, `utils`, etc. These datapacks must also be certified.
  - Your review status will be paused until those datapacks are also certified.
- If you are not the owner, **don't `steal`, `copy`, or `claim`** that you created it.
  - `Modification` or `further develop/expand/build on` should first check the **license** or **contact the owner**, and remember to **credit**.

## Note

1. We may rule a datapack out at our discretion, for reasons we would then specify.
2. This requirement is not final and can be changed in the future.

### Note from Convention Mod

- **Learn more about the convention** by reading the `Note from Convention Mod (Optional)` section, this allows you to confidently inspect your datapack before requesting review and reduces the Datapack Reviewer's workload.
- **Request review:** please include every website where your datapack is published. It doesn't have to be just `GitHub` or `Planetminecraft`. And if you're on the Minecraft Datapacks discord server, add your `Username#0000` as well.
- **Review type:** please also specify the type of review you require.
  -  **Certified Compatibility âœ… Only**
  -  **Certified Compatibility âœ… + Style Guideline Followed ðŸ“š (Optional)**
- **Datapack unreleased:** please don't DM the file; instead, use `GitHub private repo` and invite the reviewer. Don't worry about any datapack functions leaking.
- **After certified:** then your datapack will have an updated version, which you can request to review as many times as you want.
- **Request review again:** please add the `changelog` or the `location of the changed file`. And If you're using `GitHub`, we can easily check the `commit history`. By doing so, the reviewer can't waste time reviewing what they've already reviewed.
- If you have any questions about convention, you can ask on GitHub or mention `@Convention Mod` and `@Datapack Reviewer` on the discord server.
