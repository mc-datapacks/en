- Datapack must be portable, it must not be tied down to a specific save.
- Datapack must follow all of **Tier 3** Conventions.

## Note

1. We may rule a datapack out at our discretion, for reasons we would then specify.
2. This requirement is not final and can be changed in the future.

### Note from Convention Mod
- You can read the **Note from Convention Mod (Optional)** at the end of each page to understand the details of the convention and allows you to check your datapack confidently before requesting review and reduces the burden on the Datapack Reviewer.
- **Please note** that if your datapack uses `core`, `library`, `API`, `utils`, etc., from other datapackers. Those datapacks must also be certified. Your review status will be paused until those datapacks are certified too.
- As for the review requests: If you publish your datapack on more than one website, adding it would be great. It doesn't have to be just `GitHub` or `Planetminecraft`. And if you're on the Minecraft Datapacks discord server, write your `Username#0000` too
- If you have additional questions or do not understand any part, you can ask on GitHub or mention `@Convention Mod` and `@Datapack Reviewer` on the discord server.
- After being certified, Then your datapack has a version update. You can request a review as many times as you want. 
- **About request review again:** It will be helpful to the reviewer if you will write the changelog or the location of the changed file. And If you're using `GitHub`, we can easily check the commit history. But if your datapack is an unreleased version, I don't recommend you to DM the file and instead, use `GitHub private repo` and invite the reviewer instead. All datapack function is confidential, So don't worry about it leaking. By doing so, the reviewer can't waste time reviewing what they've already reviewed.
