### Note from Convention Mod
- You can read the **Note from Convention Mod (Optional)** at the end of each page. It will help you understand it in more detail. It allows you to check your datapack more confidently before request review, and reduces the burden on the Datapack Reviewer even more.
- **Please note** that if your datapack uses `core`, `library`, `api`, `utils`, etc. from other datapakers. Those datapacks must also be certified. But don't worry, datapack reviewer will let you know. Your review status will be paused until those datapacks will be certified too. **It's not wrong to use it.**
- As for the review requests: If you publish your datapack on more than one website, adding it would be great. It doesn't have to be just `GitHub` or `Planetminecraft`. And if you're on the Minecraft Datapacks discord server, write your `Username#0000` too
- If you have additional questions or do not understand any part, you can ask on GitHub or mention `@Convention Mod`, `@Datapack Reviewer` on discord server.
- After being certified, Then your datapack has a version update. You can consider repeat request review many times as you want. 
- **About request review again :** It will be helpful to the reviewer if you will write the change log or the location of the changed file. **Extra :** If you're using `GitHub`, it's easy because it can check history. But if your datapack is an unreleased version which is secret I don't recommend you to dm submit a file, reviewer has the right to deny it. Here I recommend you to use `GitHub private repo` and invite reviewer instead. All datapack function is confidential, So don't worry about it leaking. By doing so, the reviewer can't waste time reviewing what they've already reviewed.
