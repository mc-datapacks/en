# Requirement

A datapack must satisfy these requirements to receive the Certified Datapack title

- Datapack must be portable, it must not be tied down to a specific save.
- Datapack must follow all of **Tier 3** Conventions.
- Use `core`, `library`, `API`, `utils`, etc. These datapacks must also be certified.
  - Your review status will be paused until those datapacks are also certified.
- If you are not the owner, **don't `steal`, `copy`, or `claim`** that you created it.
  - `Modification` or `further develop/expand/build on` should first check the **license** or **contact the owner**, and remember to **credit**.

## Note

1. We may rule a datapack out at our discretion, for reasons we would then specify.
2. This requirement is not final and can be changed in the future.
